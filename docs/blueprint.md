# **App Name**: Cauchemar Virtuel

## Core Features:

- Terminal Simulation: Simulate a command-line interface where the user can input text commands to interact with the game's system.
- AI Chat Interface: Provide an interface to communicate with an AI that speaks in French. The AI responds to user prompts and provides hints or misdirections to enhance the horror experience, like a tool the user can choose to employ for various goals.
- Photo Viewer: Allow users to view in-game images and find clues or creepy imagery to add to the tension. Images should come with simple controls like zoom.
- Document Folder: Simulate a file system with accessible in-game documents containing narrative information, codes, or secrets.
- Internal Web Browser: Emulate a web browser with internal 'sub-sites' providing additional layers to the story.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark purple (#301934) to create a mysterious and unsettling atmosphere.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#222222), nearly black, to emphasize the darkness and add to the horror vibe.
- Accent color: Pale blue (#ADD8E6) to provide highlights on interactable elements and create contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font for a modern and clean terminal-like interface, easy to read on screen.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro', because it is specifically designed to display code clearly and will improve readability in terminal-like interfaces.
- Use minimalistic and subtly distorted icons for system apps and actions.
- Incorporate glitch effects and subtle screen distortions for key horror moments.
